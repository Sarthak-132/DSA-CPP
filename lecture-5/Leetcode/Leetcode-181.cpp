// Number of 1 bits 

// Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
// set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

// suppose int a = 8; it's binary represantation 1000 (so number of 1 bit is = 1)
// or int b = 5; binary represantation 101 (so number of 1 bit is = 2)

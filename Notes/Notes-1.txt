que. (1) what is Pseudocode?
pseudocode is a general way of representing logic of code.

que. (2) what are the data types in c++?
bool = 1 bytes,
char = 1 bytes,
int = 2 bytes, 32-bit otherwise 64-bit - 4 bytes
float = 4 bytes, 32-bit otherwise 64-bit - 8 bytes
double = 8 bytes.

que. (3) what is data structure?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

que. (4) what is algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations
or other problem-solving operations.

que. (5) why we use #include<iostream> and using namespace std;
#include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, 
such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs. 
using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

que. (6) input/cin>>/scanf reads or not to "/t, \n, space"
ans - no, it is not read the /t, \n and space. because it works always wven if you used any of these things.

Note -  cin.get() used to take ascii value of any number, charactor or symbol, spaces 

why learn C++ ?
C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.
C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.
It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs and providing security.
It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
C++ is easy to learn so that you can choose it as your first programming language.
It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.

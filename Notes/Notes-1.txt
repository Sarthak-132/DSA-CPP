que. (5) why we use #include<iostream> and using namespace std;
#include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, 
such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs. 
using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

que. (6) input/cin>>/scanf reads or not to "/t, \n, space"
ans - no, it is not read the /t, \n and space. because it works always wven if you used any of these things.

Note -  cin.get() used to take ascii value of any number, charactor or symbol, spaces
